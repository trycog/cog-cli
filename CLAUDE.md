# Rules

- If you compile use
- *NEVER* compile cog yourself, always stop and ask the user to compile
- *NEVER* attempt to launch the Zig documentation, it is a web app that you cannot access. Instead you *MUST* search the documentation on the ziglang website
- *NEVER* attempt to send direct JSON RPC to the cog MCP. It is an MCP running in Claude and you must always access it with the supplied tools from the MCP itself
